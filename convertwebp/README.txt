Automated Image-to-Video Converter

This Python script automates the conversion of a sequence of images to a video file. It utilizes the OpenCV library to read image files from a specified folder, allowing both JPG and PNG formats. The user is prompted to select the image folder via a dialog box. Additionally, the script enables the selection of frames per second (FPS) for the output video, ensuring flexibility in the final video quality. Upon execution, it seamlessly converts the images into an MP4 video file, simplifying what would otherwise be a manual and time-consuming process.
