Title:
Image Sequence to Video Converter

Description:
This Python script facilitates the effortless conversion of a sequence of images into a cohesive video file. Leveraging the OpenCV library, it enables the processing of JPG, JPEG, and PNG image formats within a designated folder.

The script employs a user-friendly tkinter-based interface to prompt users to select the folder containing the image sequence. It dynamically generates an MP4 video file as the output in the same directory as the source images.

Users are prompted to input their desired frames per second (FPS), ensuring flexibility in the video's playback speed. Upon execution, the script seamlessly orchestrates the conversion process, assembling the images into a unified video file. This automation streamlines the otherwise manual task of merging individual images into a video format, fostering enhanced efficiency and productivity.
